# What is Django?
Django is an advanced Web framework written in Python that makes use of the model view controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Django was created in a fast-moving newsroom environment, and its key objective is to ease the development of complicated, database-driven websites. 
This Web framework was initially developed for The World Company for managing some of their news-oriented sites. In July 2005, it was publicly released under a BSD license.
